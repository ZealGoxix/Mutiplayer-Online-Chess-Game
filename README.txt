Overall Note:
The main goal was to get a working base going using JavaScript and following along with some of the listed tutorials. We can focus on refining the basic gameplay while adding in some of the more advanced features.

Added Features:
- UI/UX for chess board and chess pieces using svg files from online
- Basic movement restrictions for corresponding chess pieces
	Restrictions are:
	- Chess pieces can only move in with their respective direction with relativeness to the startId, 	targetID, and squares.
	- Chess pieces cannot move to a square if another chess piece obstructs that path.
- Click and drag functionality

Features to Focus on Next:
- 'checkForCheck' and 'checkForCheckmate' functions
- Allow for either white or black to move first with user interactable choice
- Clearer updates when a move is invalid.
- Adding in special chess conditions (i.e. castling, en passant, and pawn promotions with player choice)
- UI/UX cleanup
- Online multiplayer
